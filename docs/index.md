Homey is a **desktop app for property agents** to manage clients, meetings, and transactions - all in one place. It combines the **speed of a Command Line Interface (CLI)** with the **simplicity of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, so you can work quickly while staying organised.

* If you are interested in using Homey, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f15a-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Homey, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f15a-4.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
