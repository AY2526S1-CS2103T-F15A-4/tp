## **Acknowledgements**

_{ list here sources of all reused/adapted ideas, code, documentation, and third-party libraries -- include links to the original source as well }
* The `Add Meeting` feature was inspired by the add command in [AB3](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2526S1/tp).
While the parsing and model integration logic were adapted from AB3’s `AddCommand` and `AddCommandParser`, the meeting-related components 
such as the Meeting class, meeting validation logic, and enhanced success feedback were independently designed.

* Parts of the Javadoc documentation for the features Help, Archive, Unarchive, ListMeeting, Meeting, FindByAddress, and EditMeeting,
as well as their related files, were written with assistance from [ChatGPT (OpenAI)](https://chat.openai.com).
The generated content was reviewed and adapted by our team to ensure accuracy and consistency with the project’s coding and documentation standards.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** is the core component responsible for launching and shutting down the application.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `HelpWindow` in the UI component was enhanced to open the User Guide directly in the user’s browser.  
If the browser cannot be opened (e.g., in headless environments), the fallback "Help" window remains available to copy the link manually.  
Additionally, the "Help" command can now open the specific section of the User Guide based on the topic provided (e.g., `help add`, `help edit`).
The sequence diagram below shows how the `HelpCommand` interacts with the UI to open the User Guide or display the fallback Help window.

<puml src="diagrams/help/HelpSequence.puml" width="720" />

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

Additional parsers added for this feature:
* `ArchiveCommandParser` – parses `archive INDEX`
* `UnarchiveCommandParser` – parses `unarchive INDEX`
* `ListCommandParser` – parses `list` (active) and `list archive` (archived)

#### Interactive Command Support

The Logic component has been enhanced to support interactive commands that can prompt users for missing information.

How interactive commands work:

1. When a command with missing required fields is parsed:
    * The parser creates a command object in interactive mode as indicated by a boolean flag `isInteractive`
    * Missing fields are tracked in a mutable map `missingFields`
    * Placeholder values are used for the partial object as specified by the class `PlaceholderPerson`

2. During command execution:
    * If the command is interactive, it returns a prompt for the next missing field
    * The command stays active in LogicManager and is handled using `handleInteractiveResponse` until completed
    * Each user response updates the command's internal state
    * The input `cancel` will terminate any ongoing interactive command

The sequence diagram below shows how an interactive add command flows through the system:

<puml src="diagrams/InteractiveAddSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores Homey's data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

#### Archive state & filtered lists

To support hiding archived contacts from the default view, `Person` has an immutable boolean
field `archived`. Two predicates are exposed via `Model`:
* `PREDICATE_SHOW_ACTIVE_PERSONS` – returns persons where `!person.isArchived()`
* `PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVED_PERSONS` – returns persons where `person.isArchived()`

`ModelManager` sets the current filter to **active** by default and switches filters in
`ArchiveCommand`, `UnarchiveCommand`, and `ListCommand` (see Implementation).

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both Homey's data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

#### Persisting archive state

`JsonAdaptedPerson` reads/writes an `archived` boolean. Older save files without this field
are still accepted; the value defaults to `false` (active) on load for backward compatibility.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `homey.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find Feature

#### Overview
The Find feature allows users to search for contacts using various criteria including name, address, tags, relation type, and transaction stage. It supports both partial matching (for name, address, tags) and exact matching (for relation and transaction stage).

#### Implementation

The Find feature is implemented through the following key components:

**Class Structure**

<puml src="diagrams/find/FindClass.puml" width="550"/>

The diagram above shows the main classes involved in the Find feature:
* `FindCommandParser` – Parses user input and creates the appropriate predicate based on the prefix used (none for name, `a/` for address, `t/` for tags, `r/` for relation, `s/` for transaction stage)
* `FindCommand` – Executes the find operation by applying the predicate to filter the person list
* `XYZContainsKeywordsPredicate` – Represents the family of predicate classes that implement the actual filtering logic

#### Input Validation
The `FindCommandParser` validates input based on search type:
* **Relation search**: Only accepts 'client' or 'vendor'
* **Transaction stage search**: Only accepts 'prospect', 'negotiating', or 'closed'
* **Other searches**: Accept any keywords

**Execution Flow**

<puml src="diagrams/find/FindSequence.puml" width="620"/>

The sequence diagram above illustrates how a find command is processed:

1. The user enters a find command (e.g., `find alice`)
2. `FindCommandParser` validates and parses the input, creating the appropriate predicate
3. A `FindCommand` is created with the predicate
4. When executed, `FindCommand` updates the model's filtered list using the predicate
5. The UI automatically reflects the filtered results

#### Error Handling
* Invalid relation: "Invalid relation. Only 'client' or 'vendor' are allowed"
* Invalid transaction stage: "Invalid transaction stage. Only 'prospect' or 'negotiating' or 'closed' are allowed"
* Empty search: Shows usage message for the specific search type

#### Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern
The find command uses the Strategy Pattern where different predicate classes implement the same `Predicate<Person>` interface. This allows the `FindCommand` to work with any predicate without knowing the specific filtering logic.

**Key Benefits:**
* **Extensibility**: Easy to add new search types
* **Maintainability**: Each predicate handles its own logic
* **Polymorphism**: Same interface for all predicates

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current Homey state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous Homey state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone Homey state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial Homey state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single Homey state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in Homey. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of Homey after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Homey state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified Homey state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the Homey state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Homey state, and restores Homey to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Homey state, then there are no previous Homey states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores Homey to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Homey state, then there are no undone Homey states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify Homey, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all Homey states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Homey data state.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Data archiving / unarchiving

#### Goal
Allow users to hide completed/irrelevant contacts from the default list while keeping them retrievable.

#### Model changes
* `Person` is extended with an immutable boolean `archived`.
  * Constructors accept `archived`.
  * Query helpers: `isArchived()`, `archived()` (returns a copy with `archived=true`), and
      `unarchived()` (copy with `archived=false`).
* `Model` exposes
  * `PREDICATE_SHOW_ACTIVE_PERSONS` and `PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVED_PERSONS`.
  * `ModelManager` sets the active predicate by default.

#### Storage changes
* `JsonAdaptedPerson` includes an `archived` field.
  * Missing field on load defaults to `false` for backward compatibility.

#### Logic changes
* **Archive** – `archive INDEX`
  * Validates index against the current filtered list.
  * If already archived, throws `CommandException("This person is already archived.")`.
  * Replaces the target with `person.archived()` via `model.setPerson(...)`.
  * Keeps the user in the **active** view by calling
    `model.updateFilteredPersonList(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ACTIVE_PERSONS)`.

**UML Diagrams**
  <puml src="diagrams/archive/ArchiveClass.puml" width="420" />
  <puml src="diagrams/archive/ArchiveSequence.puml" width="620" />
  <puml src="diagrams/archive/ParserClass.puml" width="420" />

* **Unarchive** – `unarchive INDEX`
  * Intended for use from the archived view.
  * Validates index; if not archived, throws `CommandException("This person is not archived.")`.
  * Replaces with `person.unarchived()` and switches the filter back to
    `PREDICATE_SHOW_ACTIVE_PERSONS` so the contact reappears in the main list.
* **List** – `list` / `list archive`
  * Implemented via `ListCommandParser`.
  * `list` (or `list active`) sets `PREDICATE_SHOW_ACTIVE_PERSONS`.
  * `list archive` sets `PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVED_PERSONS`.

**UML Diagrams**
  <puml src="diagrams/unarchive/UnarchiveClass.puml" width="420" />
  <puml src="diagrams/unarchive/UnarchiveSequence.puml" width="620" />
  <puml src="diagrams/unarchive/ParserClass.puml" width="420" />

#### Error handling (user-visible)
* Invalid index → `Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX`.
* Archiving an already archived contact → “This person is already archived.”
* Unarchiving an active contact → “This person is not archived.”

#### Rationale & alternatives
* **Why a boolean on `Person`?** Simple, stable, and cheap to persist/filter.
* **Why predicates not a field on `Model` state?** Keeps UI binding unchanged; only the predicate changes.

### List contacts by meeting date and time

#### Implementation

The proposed `list meeting` command enhances the `Logic` component by allowing users to view all contacts that have an upcoming meeting scheduled, ordered from the earliest to latest meeting date.

This feature is implemented through the new `ListMeetingCommand` class, which extends the existing `Command` abstraction and works seamlessly with the existing `ListCommandParser`.

The parsing and execution flow are as follows:
* The user enters `list meeting` in the command box.
* `AddressBookParser` detects that the command word is `list` and delegates to `ListCommandParser`.
* `ListCommandParser` interprets the argument `meeting` and returns a new `ListMeetingCommand`.
* Upon execution, `ListMeetingCommand` filters the person list to include only those with a meeting scheduled (i.e., `person.getMeeting().isPresent()`), excluding archived persons.
* The filtered list is then sorted by meeting date and time in ascending order, with names used as a secondary tiebreaker.

This ensures that the user can easily see which meetings are coming up first, providing a chronological overview of scheduled client engagements.

The following class diagram illustrates how `ListMeetingCommand` integrates with the existing `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/meeting/ListMeetingClassDiagram.puml" width="500" />

#### Example Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the feature behaves at each step.

Step&nbsp;1. The user launches the application and types the command `list meeting`.

Step&nbsp;2. `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand("list meeting")`.  
The `AddressBookParser` passes the argument `"meeting"` to `ListCommandParser`.

Step&nbsp;3. `ListCommandParser` recognizes the argument and returns a new instance of `ListMeetingCommand`.

Step&nbsp;4. `LogicManager` executes the command, which calls `model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` and `model.sortFilteredPersonListBy(comparator)` to filter and order the contacts by meeting time.

Step&nbsp;5. The UI (`PersonListPanel`) automatically refreshes to display only the persons with meetings, sorted from earliest to latest.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `list meeting` command flows through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/meeting/ListMeetingSequenceDiagram.puml" width="520" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Persons without a meeting or that have been archived are excluded from the filtered list.  
The comparator used ensures ascending order by meeting date and time; if two meetings share the same time, contacts are ordered alphabetically by name.

</box>

#### Model Interaction

The `ModelManager` exposes a sorted view layered on top of the filtered view:

* `updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` narrows the list to relevant persons (for `list meeting`: persons with a meeting and not archived).
* `sortFilteredPersonListBy(comparator)` sets a comparator on the `SortedList` that wraps the filtered list; it does not mutate data.
* `clearPersonListSorting()` removes any comparator, restoring the original order.
* `getFilteredPersonList()` returns the `SortedList<Person>` that the UI binds to.

<puml src="diagrams/meeting/ListMeetingModelDiagram.puml" width="500" />

#### Error handling (user-visible)

* Invalid `list` variant (e.g., `list mm`) →  
  `Invalid command format!` followed by
  list: Lists persons.
  Usage: list [archive | meeting]
  Examples: list | list archive | list meeting
* No contacts have meetings → command succeeds with normal success message; the list simply shows **0** persons.
* Internal failures (e.g., null model) are guarded via `requireNonNull` and handled as assertions during development; no user-visible state change occurs.

#### Rationale & alternatives

* **Why a separate `ListMeetingCommand`?**  
  Keeps the `list` family modular (mirrors `list archive`). Clear separation of concerns, easier testing, consistent with AB3’s command-per-variant pattern.

* **Why predicates rather than toggling model state?**  
  The UI already binds to an observable list. Changing only the **predicate** (and comparator) avoids additional state flags and minimises UI coupling.

* **Why the two-level ordering (date, then name)?**  
  Predictable and stable ordering in the presence of ties: first by earliest meeting, then case-insensitive alphabetical by name.

* **Alternative considered – add a `meeting` flag to `Person`**  
  Rejected. Meeting is already a dedicated value object; filtering by `Optional<Meeting>` is simpler and avoids redundancy.

* **Alternative considered – merge into `ListCommand`**  
  Rejected to prevent command bloat and branching complexity in a single class. A dedicated command keeps behaviour explicit and testable.

#### Design considerations

* **Simplicity**: Uses a `Predicate<Person>` + `Comparator<Person>` only; no new model fields or persistence changes.
* **Safety**: Nulls are guarded with `requireNonNull`. Missing meetings are treated as `LocalDateTime.MAX` so they sort to the end, but such persons are filtered out anyway.
* **Extensibility**: Future variants (e.g., `list by tag`, `list upcoming <N> days`) can reuse the same pattern with different predicates/comparators.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to incorporate meeting-based listing within the existing list framework
* **Alternative 1 (Chosen):** Introduce a dedicated `ListMeetingCommand` that cleanly extends `Command`
    * Pros: Adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle; keeps `list` behavior modular and consistent with existing `list archive` logic.
    * Cons: Adds one additional command class.

* **Alternative 2:** Merge functionality into the existing `ListCommand`
    * Pros: Fewer classes.
    * Cons: Blurs responsibility between generic listing and meeting-specific logic; complicates parser branching and testing.

---

**Rationale:**  
Alternative 1 was chosen as it offers clear separation of concerns, testability, and extensibility (future list variants like `list active`, `list by tag` can reuse the same parser pattern).

## **Documentation, logging, testing, configuration, dev-ops**

* [Documentation guide](Documentation.md)
* [Testing guide](Testing.md)
* [Logging guide](Logging.md)
* [Configuration guide](Configuration.md)
* [DevOps guide](DevOps.md)

**DevOps Rationale:**  
The DevOps setup follows the AB3 baseline with adaptations for the Homey project.  
Continuous Integration (CI) is managed via GitHub Actions, which runs tests and style checks on every push and pull request.  
This ensures consistent build quality across team members.  
The application is packaged as a single runnable JAR for portability and simplicity, following AB3’s Gradle setup.  
All tests can be executed via `gradlew check`.  
Log files are written to the local directory to support offline debugging.  
Configuration and data storage remain in JSON to preserve human-editability.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: Property Agent

* Manages a large number of client and stakeholder contacts
* Prefers desktop applications over mobile alternatives
* Has a fast typing sped
* Prefers keyboard input to mouse interaction
* Is comfortable using Command-Line Interface (CLI) applications

**Value proposition**: 

**Problem Statement**
Property agents often struggle to manage contacts, meetings, and transactions across multiple, 
unconnected platforms. Meetings tracked in separate applications are easily forgotten, 
while contact lists become difficult to organise and navigate.
Furthermore, grouping stakeholders by location or transaction stage is often tedious and time-consuming.

**Solution**
Homey provides a centralized platform that enables property agents to efficiently track, organize, and schedule contacts. 
It consolidates essential functions such as meeting visibility, contact tagging, and transaction tracking within a single interface.

**Scope and Limitations**
Homey focuses on contact and meeting management for property agents. It does not provide:
* Legal or financial tracking functionalities
* Full-fledged Customer Relationship Management (CRM) features
* Marketing, listing, or property advertisement management tools

**User Persona**:

**Profile**
A working professional and university graduate managing a large client base. 
They are experienced, independent, and often collaborate with fellow agents. 
Due to frequent travel between properties, 
they require a lightweight and convenient solution that keeps their workflow synchronised across devices.

**Behavioural Traits**
* Prefers typing commands over using a mouse
* Appreciates structured data organization and quick search capabilities
* Occasionally forgetful due to a heavy client load and overlapping meetings
* Values efficiency and minimal disruption while managing clients on the move

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Works fully offline
3. With a data file of 1000 contacts, all CRUD operations and search commands should execute and render results in under 500ms on typical hardware.
4. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
5. All user data should be persistent and survives app restarts and OS reboots.
6. Backups are stored locally
7. Data storage must be human editable text storage
8. Runs without installer, double-clickable JAR.
9. Usable at `1280×720` (`150%` scale) and higher, optimised for `1920×1080` and higher (`100/125%` scale).

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Command**: A typed instruction entered by the user to interact with the app (e.g. add, delete, find, clear)
* **Contact**: An entry in the system that stores the details of a person (name, phone number, email, address, (optional) relationship with the person or stage of transaction with the person). May represent clients and vendors
* **Tag**: A label assigned to a contact to classify them by relationship (client or vendor) and/or transaction stage (prospect, negotiating or closed)
* **Relational Tag**: An optional tag to denote the contact’s relationship with the user, for example, client or vendor
* **Client**: A contact type representing a property buyer, seller, or tenant managed by the property agent
* **Vendor**: A contact type representing third-party partners that a property agent works with during transactions (e.g. contractors, lawyers, service providers)
* **Transaction Stage Tag**: An optional tag which denotes the phase of a property deal, for example, prospect, negotiating and closed
* **Prospect**: A potential client or deal that has just been identified or contacted, but no agreement or commitment has been made yet. Used as a tag to track early-stage commitments
* **Negotiating**: A deal in progress where the property agent and client are actively discussing terms, prices or conditions. Tagged to indicate an ongoing transaction that requires a follow-up
* **Closed**: A completed deal where the transaction has been finalised (e.g. property successfully bought, sold or rented). Tagged to distinguish finished transactions from active ones
* **Reminder**: A system notification that alerts the agent about upcoming events such as meetings, deadlines or tasks
* **Meeting**: A scheduled event linked to one or more contacts, representing professional events such as property showings, negotiations or check-ins
* **Human Editable Text Storage**: Data stored in plain text format (e.g. JSON, TXT) so users can open and manually edit it outside the app if needed
* **Double-clickable JAR**: A Java Archive file packaged so that the application can be run directly by double-clicking, without needing an installer
* **Partial Match Search**: A search feature that allows results to be found even if the user types only part of a name, address or tag. The search is case-insensitive and returns all matching entries containing the keyword substring.
* **CRUD**: The four basic data operations - Create (add), Read (list/find), Update (edit/remark/transaction), and Delete (delete/clear)

## **Appendix: Effort**

* **Difficulty level**
  * Moderate to high
* **Challenges faced**
  * Ensuring meeting commands interacted correctly with existing features without breaking core functionality
  * Ensuring interactive commands did not break functionality for other commands and could work seamlessly with multiple steps
  * Designing command logic that allows flexible `remark` editing while maintaining input validation rules (e.g. length limit and empty `remark` handling).
  * Ensuring the `transaction` command correctly validates and updates only valid stages without affecting unrelated data.
  * Ensuring the `help` command worked seamlessly in both online and offline modes without causing UI freezes or blocking the main thread.
  * Handling environments that block browser access - needed fallback logic for the in-app Help window.
  * Managing URL anchor mappings so that help [TOPIC] always deep-links to the correct User Guide section, even when document headings change.
  * Implementing `archive` and `unarchive` without breaking existing `list`, `find`, and `delete` commands - required careful state tracking between active and archived lists.
  * Maintaining index consistency after archiving/unarchiving, since both lists use different data views.
  * Preventing users from accidentally interacting with archived contacts (e.g., blocking `edit` and `find` actions until unarchived).
  * Extending the find command to support multiple search types (name, address, tag, relation, transaction stage) with proper validation and error handling for each type.
  * Completely redesigning the GUI from AB3's basic list view to a modern two-panel layout with detailed contact preview, requiring significant restructuring of UI components and styling.
* **Effort required:**
  * Implemented new logic for `Meeting` class and integrated it with `AddCommand`, `EditCommand`, and `ListMeetingCommand`.
  * Implemented new logic for `InteractiveCommand` and adapted `LogicManager` for interactive add command.
  * Features `relation`, `transaction` and `remark` are adapted from AB3's [add command tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3AddRemark.html) and enhanced with improved code quality
  * Implemented RemarkCommand, RemarkCommandParser, and Remark to support adding, editing, and deleting remarks with instant UI updates. Added 100-character validation and error handling, with tests (RemarkTest, RemarkCommandParserTest) for edge cases.
  * Implemented Transaction, TransactionCommand and TransactionCommandParser to handle stage updates with validation and real-time UI reflection. Added tests (TransactionCommandParserTest) to ensure correct error handling for invalid inputs.
  * Created the HelpCommand, HelpWindow, and integrated URL anchor mapping for deep-link support.
  * Added fallback logic and event handling to open the offline Help window when the browser cannot be launched.
  * Implemented `archive` and `unarchive` commands with bidirectional state updates between the active and archived contact lists.
  * Added validation checks and user feedback messages for restricted operations on archived contacts.
  * Thoroughly tested UI behavior to ensure commands like `find` and `edit` interacted correctly with the new archive system.
  * Extended AB3's basic find command to support searching across multiple fields with prefix-based syntax. Extended FindCommandParser with field-specific validation, single/multiple keyword support, and comprehensive error messages to prevent invalid search combinations.
  * Redesigned the GUI from AB3's original layout into a modern interface with:
    * Two-panel split view (contact list + detailed preview)
    * Enhanced contact cards displaying relation and transaction stage badges, with meeting information integrated directly into each card
    * Dynamic color-coding system that turns meeting information red when the scheduled time has passed
    * Detailed contact preview panel showing all information in a structured, readable format
    * Better visual hierarchy and information organisation
* **Achievements of project:**
  * Successfully extended into a property-agent focused app supporting meeting scheduling, editing, and listing.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team size:** 5 members. 

1. **Allow names with apostrophes, hyphens, and slashes to be added correctly:**
Currently, users cannot add contacts whose names contain special characters such as apostrophes (O'Neill), hyphens (Anne-Marie), or slashes (Muhammad s/o Rahman).
This happens because the name validation rejects these characters, and in the case of slashes, the command parser interprets them as prefixes (e.g., s/).
We plan to relax the name validation rules and refine the command parser to correctly handle such names. For example, the command `add n/"Muhammad s/o Rahman" p/91234567 e/m.rahman@example.com` will successfully add the contact instead of producing an invalid command error.


2. **Allow multiple contacts with identical names to be added correctly:**  
Currently, Homey prevents users from adding a new contact if another contact with the same name already exists. This restriction forces users to artificially modify names (e.g., “John Tan 1”, “John Tan 2”) to differentiate between different clients or vendors, which reduces data clarity and makes the contact list less natural to use.
We plan to relax this restriction by identifying contacts internally using unique identifiers instead of relying on the name field for equality checks. This will involve modifying the duplicate detection logic in the `AddCommand` and `AddressBook` classes to compare contacts based on their unique IDs rather than their names.
For example, users will be able to add both “John Tan” (buyer) and “John Tan” (vendor) as separate contacts without encountering a duplicate contact error.


3. **Allow multiple phone numbers and email addresses for a single contact:**  
Currently, each contact in Homey can only store one phone number and one email address. This limits flexibility, as many clients or vendors may have multiple contact channels (e.g., personal and work numbers, or separate emails for correspondence and billing).
We plan to enhance Homey’s contact model to support multiple phone numbers and email addresses per contact. This will involve updating the `Person` class to store lists of phone numbers and email addresses, modifying the `add` and `edit` command parsers to accept multiple entries, and adjusting the UI and storage components to display and save them correctly.
For example, users will be able to add a contact such as:  
`add n/Alex Tan p/91234567 p/97865432 e/alex@gmail.com e/alex.tan@company.com`  
to store both numbers and emails under a single contact.


4. **Prevent total data loss on startup due to a single invalid field:**  
Currently, when Homey starts up and encounters a single invalid field (e.g., a corrupted phone number or improperly formatted date) in the saved data file, the entire address book fails to load. This results in complete data loss until the user manually fixes or deletes the corrupted file.
We plan to improve the data loading mechanism to perform **partial recovery** instead of rejecting the entire dataset.
Specifically, Homey will:
   - Skip only the affected entries containing invalid fields.
   - Load all remaining valid contacts into the application.
   - Display a clear error message indicating which records were skipped and why.
   
   This ensures that users do not lose all their saved contacts due to one malformed entry and improves overall data resilience.


5. **Make error message for `relation` more specific:**
Currently, the error message for `relation` is:
`Invalid command format!
relation: Edits relation tag of the person identified by the index number used in the last person listing. Existing relation tag will be overwritten.
Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer) [client/vendor]
Example: relation 1 client`, including redundant information which forces users to read through a verbose message before finding the relevant information.
We plan to make the error message more targeted by reducing the message content to:
`Invalid command format!
Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer) [client/vendor]
Example: relation 1 client`.


6. **Make error message for `remark` more specific:**
Currently, the error message for `remark` is:
`Invalid command format! 
remark: Edits the remark of the person identified by the index number used in the last person listing.
Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer) rm/[REMARK] (must not be more than 100 characters)
Example: remark 1 rm/Prefers properties in the East.`, including redundant information which forces users to read through a verbose message before finding the relevant information.
We plan to make the error message more targeted by reducing the message content to:
`Invalid command format! 
Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer) rm/[REMARK] (must not be more than 100 characters)
Example: remark 1 rm/Prefers properties in the East.`.


7. **Make error message for `transaction` more specific:**
Currently, the error message for `transaction` is:
`Invalid command format! 
transaction: Edits the transaction stage of the person identified by the index number used in the last person listing. Existing transaction stage will be overwritten by the input.
Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer) s/ TRANSACTION STAGE
Example: transaction 1 s/prospect`, including redundant information which forces users to read through a verbose message before finding the relevant information.
We plan to make the error message more targeted by reducing the message content to:
`Invalid command format! 
Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer) s/ TRANSACTION STAGE
Example: transaction 1 s/prospect`.


8. **Make “no results” message for find a/ more specific:**
Currently, when a user searches for an address using find a/ and there are no matching contacts, Homey displays a generic message:
`0 persons listed!`
This message does not clearly indicate that the search was performed using the address field, which may confuse users who expect address-specific feedback.
We plan to make the message more targeted by updating it to:
`No contacts found in the specified area.`
This enhancement improves clarity and user experience by providing context-aware feedback that directly reflects the user’s search intent when using `find a/`.
